We are happy på guide you to our favourites :-). Trains and Metro are also a few minutes away by foot.\",\"What else is nearby?<br />To be honest, We think our neighbourhood \"\"Vesterbro\"\" is the coolest in Copenhagen. Just 100 meters away you have Sdr. Boulevard, which is a lovely open boulevard, where lots of the cool kids hang out in the afternoon and evening. \"\"Kødbyen\"\" (The old meat packing district), which has now been made into trendy restaurents, bars and nightclubs, is only 350 meters away. If you feel more like authentic old bars, there are plenty nearby.. There are lots of parks and playgrounds in the neighborhood. The beautiful harbour is great for swimming and only 1 km away. You will be able to manage you days here on foot, but we also highly recommend biking around. Since 2015, Copenhagen has been ranked the world\\'s top cycling city several times.

This diverse district, on the northern side of Copenhagen’s lakes, is a dazzling blend of historic landmarks, ultramodern architecture and food and drink joints to make this famously gourmet city proud. Even during this harshest of years, new bakeries, restaurants and natural wine bars have proliferated – and it almost goes without saying that they all put a focus on local, seasonal produce (quite a lot of it foraged, probably). This year has also seen community initiatives flourish: Car-Free Sunday made its comeback, swapping traffic on Nørrebrogade for live music and flea markets, while Usynlige Stier (‘Invisible Paths’) is a new, interactive art exhibition that brings fun and a splash of colour to the neighbourhood’s most vulnerable areas.\"\"\",\"https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/261aa506-7b13-484c-8920-6a87133731fb.jpg\",\"1379904\",\"https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/1379904\",\"Nina\",\"2011-11-07\",\"Copenhagen, Denmark\",\"Hej -  I read the Master in Pedagogy.
